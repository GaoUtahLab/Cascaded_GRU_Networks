General info:
This directory contains transfer matrix code to fit Landau polariton dispersions shown in Figure 4 of main text. 

Environment used:
1. Matlab R2021b


Folder info:
1. 'data.mat' is the mat file containing data
2. 'predict_exp_polariton_fit.m' is the main function to do the fitting. Just run this file and it will generate two figures. One is the polariton fitting for physics-model learned resonance frequencies and one is the polariton fitting for experimental results. 
3. 'fitted_prediction.fig' and 'fitted_target.fig' are two output figures from the program in (2). 

installation time: < N/A.
running time: < a few seconds.
